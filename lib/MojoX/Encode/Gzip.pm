=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use MojoX:Encode::Gzip;

    # Simple
    MojoX::Encode::Gzip->new->maybe_gzip($tx);

    # With options
    my $gzip = MojoX::Encode::Gzip->new(
        min_bytes => 600,
        max_bytes => 600000,
    );
    $success = $gzip->maybe_gzip($tx);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Gzip compress a Mojo::Message::Response if client supports it.

=head2 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<min_bytes>

The minumum number of bytes in the body before we would try to gzip it. Trying to gzip really
small messages can take extra CPU power on the server and client without saving any times. Defaults
to 500.

=head2 C<max_bytes>

The maximum number of bytes in the body before we give up on trying gzip it. Gzipping very large messages
can delay the response and possibly exhaust system resources. Defaults to 500000.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<maybe_gzip>

    my $success = $gzip->maybe_gzip($tx);

Given a L<Mojo::Transaction> object, possibly gzips transforms the response by
gzipping it. Returns true if we gzip it, and undef otherwise.  The behavior is
modified by the C<< min_bytes >> and C<< max_bytes >> attributes.

Currently we only only try to gzip Content-types that start with "text/", or end in "xml" or "javascript",
along with "application/json". This may be configurable in the future.
